# RoN_Automizer
A collection of AHK macros for the Roblox game, RIse of Nations, under one GUI. 
FIrst test release of a macro GUI I made, for you all to try out. 
First, THIS REQUIRES AUTOHOTKEY, SEARCH FOR IT ON GOOGLE, ITS FREE AND SAFE
Do note that there are a few issues with this at the moment that will be patched in future updates
-Auto Justify on Kazak and Taiwan doesnt fully work on fullscreen, unless you move the mouse to clear the country search box it uses to search taiwan and kazak due to coordinate shifts in fullscreen, but works fine (barely) on Maximized Window
-If using with fullscreen, you must alt tab to switch windows to the GUI itself, do not worry, it automatically refocuses your window in this case.
-War democracy not availible yet (Still yet to be worked on)

UPCOMING CHANGES:
-Increased Reliability of Auto justify
-Auto groups deletes any groups previously created
-Update functionality built into the script itself.
